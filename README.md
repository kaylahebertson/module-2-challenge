## Description

[Visit the Deployed Site]()

This project was the first step in creating a portfolio where I will be able to showcase all future work and projects I make throughout coding bootcamp and my future jobs. I wrote code for an HTML and CSS to create a place where I can show off what I learn. 

Here is a screenshot of what my portfolio looks like now:
